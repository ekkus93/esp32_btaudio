# ESP32 Bluetooth Audio Source

This project implements the Bluetooth A2DP audio source component of the ESP32 Audio Project. It receives I2S audio data from another ESP32 and streams it to Bluetooth speakers or headphones.

## Features

- **A2DP Audio Source:** Implements the Bluetooth Advanced Audio Distribution Profile
- **I2S Audio Input:** Receives digital audio via I2S interface from the WiFi Controller ESP32
- **Serial Command Interface:** Accepts control commands over UART
- **Multiple Device Support:** Can scan for and connect to various Bluetooth audio sinks
- **Pairing Management:** Supports different pairing methods including "Just Works" and PIN-based pairing

## Hardware Configuration

### GPIO Assignments (ESP32 WROOM32)

**I2S Audio Interface:**
- BCLK (Bit Clock): GPIO26
- WCLK/LRCLK (Word/LR Clock): GPIO25
- DATA IN: GPIO22 (receives audio data from WiFi ESP32)
- DATA OUT: GPIO21 (optional, if needed)

**Serial Communication:**
- Using UART1 (separate from USB programming port UART0)
- RX: GPIO16 (receives commands)
- TX: GPIO17 (sends responses/events)

I2S and UART: practical defaults and recommendations
- I2S recommended default format: 16-bit PCM, stereo, 44.1 kHz (44100 Hz). This minimizes runtime processing on the Bluetooth ESP32 — send raw PCM frames from the decoder/producer ESP32 over I2S for the lowest CPU load on the Bluetooth device.
- I2S master/slave recommendation: make the audio producer (the ESP32 doing decoding/producing samples) the I2S master and this Bluetooth ESP32 the I2S slave. That way the producer supplies BCLK/WCLK and the BT device simply consumes the samples.
- UART defaults: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit ("115200 8N1"). Commands are newline-terminated (\n).
- USB-serial adapter / TTL note: Use a 3.3V TTL USB-serial adapter (for example FTDI, CP2102, CH340 variants). Do not connect 5V-level UART adapters directly to the ESP32 pins. Cross RX/TX and always connect a common ground.

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Initial A2DP source implementation
- [x] Add I2S driver configuration for receiving audio
- [x] Implement serial command protocol
- [~] Add pairing management functionality (in-progress)
  - Notes: Host-side command handlers and event streaming for pairing (PIN request / SSP confirm) are implemented and covered by host unit tests; on-device end-to-end pairing verification remains.
- [x] Add volume/mute control
- [~] Implement device scanning and connection management (partial)
  - [x] Add persistent settings storage in NVS

Notes on progress:
- I2S driver configuration (modern standard-mode API) and an audio processing task are implemented. The code exposes runtime setters to change I2S pins and sample rate.
- The serial command protocol has been implemented in `components/command_interface` and supports commands such as `SCAN`, `CONNECT`, `DISCONNECT`, `START`, `STOP`, `VOLUME`, `I2S_CONFIG`, `PAIR` and `UNPAIR`. Handlers are implemented with ESP guards so host-based unit tests remain functional.
- Volume and mute controls are implemented in the audio processor (`audio_processor_set_volume`, `audio_processor_set_mute`) and are wired into the command handlers.
- Device scanning and connection management APIs are available in `components/bt_manager` (scan/connect/disconnect functions). The scanning result/event streaming and full pairing flows (PIN/SSP confirmation and persistent pairing state) remain to be completed and tested on device.

Notes on recent progress:
- A small NVS persistence component (`components/nvs_storage`) was added and registered with CMake. Configuration keys for volume, I2S pins, local device name and a default PIN are persisted and retrieved via that component.
- The audio processor and command handlers now persist changes (volume and I2S pin updates) to NVS. The command `SET_NAME` and `SET_DEFAULT_PIN` persist values as well.
- Bluetooth initialization was updated to read the persisted local device name from NVS at boot and apply it (GAP API with guarded deprecated fallback), so persisted device name now takes effect on startup.

Recent work (pairing & events):
- Pairing event streaming: GAP pairing events (PIN requests, SSP numeric confirmation, auth complete) are forwarded to the serial command interface as `EVENT|PAIR|...` messages so a host can drive the pairing flow.
- Command replies for pairing: `CONFIRM_PIN` and `ENTER_PIN` command handlers now call the appropriate GAP reply APIs on-device (`esp_bt_gap_ssp_confirm_reply()` and `esp_bt_gap_pin_reply()`), falling back to a stored default PIN from NVS when available. These handlers are guarded by `#ifdef ESP_PLATFORM` for host-test compatibility.

Recent changes (host-test and pairing work)
- Host unit-test harness under `test/host_test` updated with additional mocks and tests to validate command handlers without device hardware.
- Added minimal host-side mocks for Bluetooth GAP responses and NVS (`test/host_test/mocks/mock_gap.c`, `mocks/nvs_storage_mock.c`, `mocks/esp_bt.h`, `mocks/esp_err.h`) so `CONFIRM_PIN` and `ENTER_PIN` command handlers can be exercised by unit tests.
- `components/command_interface/commands.c` has a small host-path branch that parses MAC and calls the GAP reply mocks so host tests can assert the expected behavior.

Next high-priority tasks:
- Implement pairing confirmation flows and streaming of scan/pairing events to the command interface (PIN requests, SSP confirmations, pairing results).
- Add/extend host unit tests to cover the command handlers and NVS-backed persistence logic.
- Finalize the pairing interaction loop and on-device verification (ensure host commands such as `CONFIRM_PIN` and `ENTER_PIN` trigger the expected GAP replies and that the full pairing flow succeeds on-device).
- Add/extend host unit tests to cover the command handlers and NVS-backed persistence logic.

How to run host unit tests (fast, on your development machine)

1. Create and enter a build directory for host tests:

```bash
cd /home/phil/work/esp32/esp32_btaudio/esp_bt_audio_source/test/host_test
mkdir -p build_host_tests && cd build_host_tests
cmake ..
```

2. Build the test runner (example: `test_commands`):

```bash
cmake --build . --target test_commands -j$(nproc)
```

3. Run the test binary and capture output:

```bash
./test_commands |& tee test_commands.log
echo "exit code: $?"
```

Notes:
- The host-test harness compiles production code with `ESP_PLATFORM` undefined and links in test mock implementations from `test/host_test/mocks/` so tests run on your Linux machine.
- If a test fails, edit or extend the mocks under `test/host_test/mocks/` (for example `mock_gap.c` or `nvs_storage_mock.c`) to simulate the expected runtime behavior.

If you'd like, I can also add a short `test/host_test/README.md` with these commands and a quick map of where the mocks live.
## Serial Command Protocol

Notes about commands and responses

- Commands are case-sensitive. Use uppercase command tokens (for example: `SCAN`, `CONNECT`, `START`).
- Line endings: commands must end with a newline character (`\n`). The parser expects the exact format and may reject extra whitespace.
- Error response format (recommended): `ERR|<COMMAND>|<CODE>|<MESSAGE>`
   - Example: `ERR|CONNECT|NOT_FOUND|Device not in range`
   - Suggested error codes: `BAD_SYNTAX`, `BAD_PARAM`, `NOT_FOUND`, `BUSY`, `FAILED`.
- IO convention used in this README: `>` denotes user/host input, `<` denotes device output (responses or events).

Persistent storage and small-file storage

- NVS is used for configuration and small structured data (paired device entries, config keys). The partition table includes an `nvs` partition by default.
- If you need to store small audio clips (e.g., .wav), add SPIFFS or LittleFS to the partition table and store files there. Keep file sizes small or use external flash for large media.

Testing suggestions

- Host-based unit tests: put parser and business logic behind an interface and mock ESP-IDF APIs. Use the `test/host_test` CMake host-test harness to run fast tests on your development machine.
- On-device: keep Unity-based tests in `test_app` for integration verification. Run fast host tests during development and run on-device tests before major merges.

## Build and Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- ESP-IDF v4.4 or newer
- Python 3.6 or newer
- Git
- A compatible ESP32 development board (WROOM32)
- USB cable for connecting to your development board

### Setting up the Environment

1. Install ESP-IDF following the [official installation guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html)

2. Activate the ESP-IDF environment:
   ```bash
   . $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh  # Adjust path if necessary
   ```

### Configuring the Project

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/phil/work/esp32/esp32_btaudio/esp_bt_audio_source
   ```

2. Configure the project using the ESP-IDF tool:
   ```bash
   idf.py menuconfig
   ```

3. Ensure the following settings are configured:
   - In "Component config" → "Bluetooth" → Enable "Bluedroid Enable"
   - In "Bluedroid Options" → Enable "Classic Bluetooth" and "A2DP"

### Building and Flashing

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   idf.py build
   ```

2. Flash the firmware to the ESP32:
   ```bash
   idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
   ```
   Replace `PORT` with your device's serial port (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux)

## Unit Testing Framework

This project uses a dual testing approach for faster Test-Driven Development (TDD):

### 1. Host-based Testing (Primary for TDD)

Host-based tests run on your development computer rather than on the ESP32, providing:
- Much faster test cycles without device flashing
- Better debugging capabilities
- Easy integration with CI/CD pipelines

**Setup:**

1. Create a test directory structure:
   ```
   esp_bt_audio_source/
   ├── test/
   │   ├── host_test/          # Tests that run on development PC
   │   │   ├── CMakeLists.txt
   │   │   ├── test_commands.c
   │   │   ├── test_bluetooth.c
   │   │   └── mocks/          # Mock implementations of ESP-IDF
   │   │       ├── esp_bt.h
   │   │       ├── mock_i2s.c
   │   │       └── mock_uart.c
   ```

2. Create a CMake-based build system for host tests:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p build_host_tests && cd build_host_tests
   cmake ../test/host_test
   make
   ./run_tests
   ```

### 2. On-device Testing (for Integration Verification)

On-device tests use ESP-IDF's Unity framework integration:

1. Create an on-device test component:
   ```
   esp_bt_audio_source/
   ├── test_app/              # Separate test application
   │   ├── main/
   │   │   └── test_app_main.c
   │   ├── components/
   │   └── CMakeLists.txt
   ```

2. Use ESP-IDF's built-in Unity test framework:
   ```c
   #include "unity.h"
   #include "bt_source.h"
   
   TEST_CASE("Test Bluetooth connection", "[bluetooth]")
   {
       // Test code here
       TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL(ESP_OK, bt_init());
   }
   ```

3. Flash and run:
   ```bash
   cd test_app
   idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
   ```

### 3. Component Design for Testability

To make your code more testable:

- Create clear interfaces and modules with single responsibilities
- Use dependency injection to allow mocking of ESP-IDF components
- Separate hardware-dependent code from business logic
- Use function pointers for hardware access to enable mocks

**Example testable component structure:**
```
esp_bt_audio_source/
├── components/
│   ├── bt_manager/          # Bluetooth functionality
│   │   ├── include/         # Public headers
│   │   └── bt_manager.c     # Implementation
│   ├── command_interface/   # Serial command handling
│   │   ├── include/
│   │   └── commands.c
│   └── audio_pipeline/      # Audio processing 
```

### 4. Sample Test Implementation 

Example test for the command parser:

```c
// test_commands.c
#include "unity.h"
#include "command_interface.h"

void setUp(void) {
    // Initialize before each test
    cmd_init();
}

void tearDown(void) {
    // Clean up after each test
    cmd_deinit();
}

TEST_CASE("Parse SCAN command", "[commands]") {
    cmd_context_t ctx;
    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL(CMD_SUCCESS, cmd_parse("SCAN", &ctx));
    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL(CMD_TYPE_SCAN, ctx.type);
}
```

Running tests becomes part of your normal development cycle:
1. Write a failing test
2. Implement functionality to pass the test
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing
4. Repeat
